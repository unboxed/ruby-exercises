# Getting Started (Do this before attemping any exercises)

Make sure to fork this repo to your local account.

You can follow `Fork an example repository`, `Keep your fork synced` at the [github help](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/#fork-an-example-repository)
but instead of `octocat/Spoon-Knife` use `unboxed/ruby-exercises`.

# General Flow

```
  git checkout master
  git fetch upstream
  git checkout -b [exercise_name]
  git branch --set-upstream-to origin/[exercise_name]
  git merge upstream/[exercise_name]
  git commit --allow-empty -m "Starting" # we do allow-empty because there will be no files to commit but it's used as marker of when you started the exercise
  # Follow EXERCISE.md
  # ...

  # make sure all everything is committed
  # git push origin [exercise_name]
  # Create Pull request when Done (Ask for help if you don't know how)
  #   base_fork: unboxed/ruby-exercises base: [exercise_name] ... base_fork: [username]/ruby-exercises base: [exercise_name]
```

do `rails-getting-started` exercise first to test the flow

```
  git checkout master
  git fetch upstream
  git checkout -b rails-getting-started
  git branch --set-upstream-to origin/rails-getting-started
  git merge upstream/rails-getting-started
  git commit --allow-empty -m "Starting"
  # Follow EXERCISE.md
  # ...

  # make sure all everything is committed
  # git push origin rails-getting-started
